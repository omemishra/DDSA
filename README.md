# Domain Data Search and Analysis Tool

The Domain Data Search and Analysis Tool is a powerful command-line utility designed to fetch and analyze data associated with a given domain. It provides a comprehensive set of features to gather valuable information from various sources and perform targeted searches for emails, sessions, API keys, and custom patterns.

## Key Features

- **Data Fetching**: Utilizes the "gau" command-line tool to fetch domain data from different sources, providing a rich dataset for analysis.
- **Data Storage**: Stores the fetched data in a file named after the MD5 hash of the domain, ensuring uniqueness and integrity.
- **URL Decoding**: Decodes URL-encoded data within the fetched results, enabling accurate analysis of the extracted information.
- **Email Extraction**: Searches and identifies email addresses within the fetched data, excluding emails with invalid file extensions such as .svg, .png, .jpg, or .jpeg.
- **Session Identification**: Identifies sessions using a pattern matching approach, extracting session tokens or identifiers from the fetched data.
- **API Key Detection**: Detects API keys using a regex-based search, allowing the identification of sensitive information associated with the domain.
- **Custom Pattern Search**: Enables users to define and search for custom patterns within the fetched data, providing flexibility for targeted analysis.
- **Path Inclusion**: Displays the full URL path where each email is found, allowing users to identify the specific context of email occurrences.
